Thank you, Your Honor, for your thoughtful questions. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify our position regarding the preemption issue and the implications of the FDA's actions in this case.

First, addressing the standard of "clear and convincing evidence" applied by the Third Circuit: We contend that the FDA's explicit rejection of Merck's proposed warning is, in itself, compelling evidence of preemption. The Wyeth v. Levine decision recognized that if the FDA would not have approved a warning that state law would require, then the manufacturer cannot be held liable under state law for failing to provide that warning. The FDA's decision should not be viewed as merely a suggestion or a matter of conjecture; it is a definitive action taken by an agency with the authority and expertise to evaluate the safety and efficacy of drug labeling. 

The FDA's rejection of Merck's proposal was not arbitrary; it was based on a comprehensive review of the scientific data, including studies that Merck itself submitted. This highlights that the FDA had the opportunity to consider the risks and benefits thoroughly. Therefore, requiring further inquiry into the FDA's reasoning or hypothetical future actions would undermine the agency's role and the regulatory framework designed to ensure drug safety. 

Regarding the balance between the FDA's decision-making and state tort law claims, it is crucial to recognize that the FDA operates under a rigorous scientific standard. If the FDA determined that the evidence did not warrant a label change, it reflects the agency's judgment that such a change could be misleading or unnecessary based on the available data. Allowing a jury to second-guess this decision would not only disrupt the uniformity intended by federal regulation but also risk creating a patchwork of state law that could conflict with the FDA's conclusions. 

In relation to the decision in PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, the parallels are indeed instructive. In Mensing, this Court held that federal regulations preempted state law claims against generic drug manufacturers because they were unable to independently change their labels. Similarly, Merck's inability to unilaterally change its label after the FDA's rejection illustrates the same principle of impossibility preemption. The regulatory constraints imposed by the FDA are paramount, and when the agency has taken a definitive stance, as it did here, state law claims should yield to that federal authority.

In conclusion, Your Honor, the FDA's rejection of Merck's proposed warning is not merely an event to be weighed against other factors; it is a decisive action that underscores the impossibility of compliance with both federal and state law. We respectfully argue that allowing state tort claims to proceed in this context not only contradicts the FDA's authority but also undermines the very regulatory framework designed to protect public health. Thank you.
