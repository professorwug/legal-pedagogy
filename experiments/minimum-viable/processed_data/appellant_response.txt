Thank you, Your Honor, for your thoughtful questions. I will address each of your concerns in turn.

First, regarding the standard of "clear evidence" as articulated in *Wyeth v. Levine*, the FDA's rejection of Merck's proposed warning is indeed compelling evidence of preemption. The Court in *Wyeth* emphasized that preemption applies when it is clear that the FDA would not have approved a warning that state law requires. In this case, the FDA's rejection was based on its assessment of the scientific evidence at hand, which included a comprehensive safety update from Merck that outlined the potential risks associated with Fosamax. The FDA explicitly stated that it did not have a clear path forward due to the conflicting nature of the literature and needed more time to consider the implications of these studies. This rejection reflects a definitive decision by the FDA that no additional warning could be approved at that time, thereby meeting the *Wyeth* standard of clear evidence that the state law claim is preempted.

Second, regarding the Third Circuit's finding that a jury could determine Merck did not meet the "clear and convincing evidence" standard, this position fundamentally misunderstands the regulatory framework. The FDA's need for more time to evaluate the evidence does not negate the fact that it rejected the proposed warning. The FDA’s decision-making process is inherently complex and involves extensive review of scientific data. The Third Circuit’s suggestion that a jury could speculate on the FDA’s reasoning undermines the deference that courts should afford to federal regulatory agencies, particularly in areas where they have specialized expertise. The regulatory framework does not allow for conjecture; it demands adherence to the FDA's decisions as authoritative and final in matters of drug labeling.

Third, concerning the practical implications of ruling in favor of Merck, it is essential to recognize that such a ruling would not insulate drug manufacturers from all liability. Rather, it would reinforce the principle that federal law, particularly FDA regulations, governs the labeling of drugs. This is a necessary balance to ensure that drug manufacturers can rely on the FDA's expertise and decisions without fear of conflicting state law claims. If the FDA has rejected a proposed warning, it would create a dangerous precedent for state tort claims that could undermine the uniformity and predictability of drug regulation across the country. It is vital for manufacturers to know that once they have acted in accordance with FDA directives, they are protected from liability based on state law that contradicts those directives.

Finally, with respect to the timeline of events and the FDA's eventual acknowledgment of a potential association, it is crucial to focus on the FDA's position at the time of the initial rejection. The preemption analysis must be grounded in the regulatory landscape as it existed when Merck sought to modify its label. The FDA's later confidence in the association does not retroactively alter the legality of Merck's actions at the time of the rejection. The law must be clear and certain, and holding manufacturers liable for decisions made under the guidance of the FDA would create a chilling effect on the pharmaceutical industry’s willingness to engage with regulatory bodies.

In conclusion, Your Honor, the evidence in this case strongly supports the position that Merck’s failure-to-warn claims are preempted. The FDA's rejection of the proposed warning is clear evidence that state law cannot impose additional obligations on the manufacturer that conflict with federal law. Thank you for your attention, and I welcome any further questions you may have.
