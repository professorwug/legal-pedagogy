Thank you, counsel, for your presentation. I have a few questions regarding the preemption issue at hand, particularly in light of our precedent in Wyeth v. Levine.

First, let's discuss the standard of "clear and convincing evidence" that the Third Circuit applied. In Wyeth, we acknowledged that impossibility preemption could apply if the FDA would not have approved a label change. Here, you argue that the FDA's rejection of Merck's proposed warning should suffice to establish preemption. Could you elaborate on why the FDA's rejection should be considered definitive evidence of preemption, rather than requiring further inquiry into the FDA's reasoning or potential future actions?

Additionally, I'm interested in your interpretation of the FDA's role in this context. Given the FDA's expertise and authority in drug labeling, how should we balance the FDA's decision-making process with state tort law claims? Does the FDA's rejection of a label change inherently imply that state law claims are preempted, or is there room for a jury to consider other factors, such as the sufficiency of the data presented to the FDA or changes in scientific consensus?

Finally, considering our decision in PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, where we found impossibility preemption due to federal regulations governing generic drug labels, how does that case inform your argument here? Are there parallels in the regulatory constraints faced by Merck that would support a finding of preemption?

I appreciate your insights on these matters as we consider the implications of federal preemption in the context of drug labeling and state tort claims.
