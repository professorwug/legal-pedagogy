Thank you, counsel, for your presentation. I have a few questions regarding the preemption issue and the implications of the FDA's actions in this case.

First, in Wyeth v. Levine, we established that FDA approval does not automatically preempt state-law failure-to-warn claims unless there is clear evidence that the FDA would have rejected a label change. Here, you argue that the FDA's rejection of Merck's proposed warning constitutes such clear evidence. Could you elaborate on how the FDA's rejection meets the standard of "clear evidence" as articulated in Wyeth?

Second, the Third Circuit's decision seems to hinge on the idea that a jury could find that Merck did not meet the "clear and convincing evidence" standard. How do you reconcile this with the regulatory framework that governs the FDA's decision-making process? Specifically, what role should the FDA's stated need for more time to consider the issue play in our analysis of preemption?

Additionally, I am interested in understanding the practical implications of adopting your position. If we were to rule in favor of Merck, how would this affect the balance between federal regulatory authority and state tort law? Would it effectively insulate drug manufacturers from liability in cases where the FDA has not definitively rejected a warning, but has expressed uncertainty or requested further information?

Finally, considering the FDA's eventual acknowledgment of a potential association, how should we view the timeline of events in relation to Merck's duty to warn? Does the fact that the FDA later became confident in the association impact the preemption analysis, or is our focus strictly on the FDA's position at the time of the initial rejection?

Thank you, counsel. I look forward to your responses to these questions.
